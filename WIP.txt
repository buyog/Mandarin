Mandarin WIP page; obviously still a lot to be done!

McCready's original notes:
 1-iceman - raio de gelo ....special, stand = freezes
 2- mukai - Mental Paralysis.... hyper level 1, stand, = paralizes P2 and hits him on walls and floor
 3------- Electro Blast....special, stand = shock
 4-dhalsim - fire blast.... special, crouch = burns
 5------- Holographic Illusions.... especial = creates 2 cópias...the 3 attack.(real one that hits is determined by button)
 6- Thanos - Light Blast.... special, stand = hitwall
 7 -bishamon - black light.... hyper level 1 = screen goes dark(palfx) and mandarin get's in custom combo mode
 8- bishamon - desintegration beam.... hyper level 3 = hit
 9------- vortex ring (flight).... flight mode
10- bishamon - force blast.... hyper level 1, stand, air = hit
11- rikuo - sonic beam.... special, air = makes P2 dizzy
12- magneto - magnetic waves.... hyper level 1= like magneto's
13------- teleportation.... special
14- fumaca_roxa.gif - poison gas.... hyper level 1 = P2 loses energy lil by lil
15- mukai - solidify gas.... special = rocks appear on air and fall (different distances)
