	!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
	Things that will hack me off related to the use of this character:
	- Don't host it on your site unless you ASK first, and give us the
	    proper credit. Email isn't hard, and I'll probably say yes,
	    so don't be afraid to ask. =P
	- If you got this character from somewhere other than ScruffyDragon.com 
	    or my site, Buyog.com, it's quite possible that it's been hacked and/or modified
	    without my permission, and not all the moves and animations may be very good.
	    Best to get it from a trusted source and be confident in its integrity.
	!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!


GAMEPLAY
----------------------------------

Mandarin's got a 6-button play style:

* x - Weak Punch (WP)
* y - Medium Punch (MP)
* z - Hard Punch (HP)
* a - Weak Kick (WK)
* b - Medium Kick (MK)
* c - Hard Kick (HK)
* d,u:  Super Jump (KKK will trigger it too)
* f,f:  Dash Forward (PPP will also work)
* b,b:  Dash Back (PPP while holding back will also do the trick)


NOTE
----------------------------------
Mandarin is my first character primarily developed on MUGEN 1.0, but I've gone to the effort of making sure it works in WinMUGEN too.
As for older versions of DOS/Linux MUGEN, good luck, I haven't tested him there. If it works for you, great; if not, please let me know.


SPECIALS

 - Poison Gas: QCF + P
 * not done:
	- freezing ray -- stand = freezes
	- electro blast -- stand = shock
	- flare burst -- crouch = burns
	- Holographic Illusions = creates 2 clones...the 3 attack.(real one that hits is determined by button)
	- Light Blast -- stand = hitwall
	- sonic wave -- air = makes P2 dizzy
	- teleport
	- solidify gas = rocks appear on air and fall (different distances)
	- force field generator = superblock, repels P2

----------------------------------
 * not done:
	- Mental Paralysis.... hyper level 1, stand, = paralizes P2 and hits him on walls and floor

COMBO SYSTEM
----------------------------------

Capcom-style chain combos work for standing, crouching, and air:

1. WP+MP+SP: you can chain the three punches together, weakest to strongest, for a 3 or 4 hit combo.
2. WK+MK+SK: like the punches, you can chain the three kicks together as well.
3. (in air) WP+WK+MP+MK+SP: The basic "zigzag" combo. Chains up to 6 hits.

Launcher: TBD
